# Maths-Game
A simple mathematics game created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project consists of multiple choice questions with four options where the questions and answers are randomly generated. A timer of one minute is included and a scoreboard is maintained which increments and decrements the score with respect to the answers selected.
